    Added Bar Charts 
    Added FindNearestPoint() method 
    Minor Bug Fixes 
    Added zero-line when axis ranges from negative to positive

1-Mar-2004 (Release 1.3)
    Added Date-Time Axis capability 
    Added Text Axis capability 
    Added ReverseTransform() function (returns axis values associated with a mousePt location on the graph) 
    Made some optimizations that dramatically increase the drawing speed for large datasets 
    Updated code to implement ICloneable interface and copy constructor for primary classes
