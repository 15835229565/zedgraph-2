ZedGraph Class Library Revision History

1-Sep-2004 (by Champion)
    Fix grace so that it won't extend across negative/positive boundary
    Finish up #region's

31-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Added Curve Smoothing (Line.IsSmooth, Line.SmoothTension)
    Added PointPair.IsInvalid
    Added PointPair implicit cast to PointF
	
31-Aug-2004 (by Vos)
    Cleaned up some of the files, making the #region'ing more consistent (some files still need to be done)

30-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Fix single point plotting (bug in validity checking code)
    Fix calls to Transform() so that Transform(i,x) is only called for bar charts
    Fix XML Comments to get rid of error messages
    Change the AddPoints() methods of PointPairList to overloaded Add()
    Add a couple unit tests
    
30-Aug-2004 (by Vos)
    Added locking to the ZedGraphControl to make it thread safe
    Added a .AxisChange() method to the ZedGraphControl (it creates a new Graphics object every time it is called)
    Added a ZedGraphException class
    ZGC.Image now throws a ZedGraphException if the control has been disposed
    Added a ZGC.BeenDisposed property, which checks if the GraphPane is null. This probably should have a separate field in the ZGC called beenDisposed, but for now it doesn't.
    Projects now reference the main ZedGraph by using project references instead of direct .dll references

27-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Add MinGrace and MaxGrace
    Fix up overlapping labels with double PickScale() call

26-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Fix problem with zero/negative values on Y Log scale
    Add long unittest
    clean up unit test code to three fixtures

25-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Make constructors handle null values better
    Integrate multiple constructors so default usage is cleaner
    Move Default struct into each class (get rid of Def.cs)
    extensive additions to unittest

23-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Fix NaN handling so it doesn't cause exceptions

18-Aug-2004 (by Vos)
    Add Image property
    Add ColorSymbolRotator
    
17-Aug-2004 (by Champion)
    Fix overlapping labels logic for X vs Y axes
    Fix scaleFormat in copy constuctor
    Add Point indexer to CurveItem
    Fix problem with recursive loop for text label calcs

25-Jul-2004 (by Champion)
    Add XTargetSteps, YTargetSteps
    New Format for 10 power log scale labels
    Fixed drawing of log scales
    Improved logic for scale picking
    Add logic to reduce text labels if they are overlapping
    Added IsIgnoreMissing
    Added IsFontsScaled
    Fixed FindNearestPoint() for bars
    
16-Jul-2004 (by Vos)
    Add PointPair, PointPairList storage for data points

15-Jul-2004
    Add Author/Revision XML tags
    
14-Jul-2004
    Added LGPL

13-Jul-2004 (Release 1.5)
    Added AxisType.Ordinal 
    Added Def.Ax.MaxTextLabels and made Text labels honor the Axis.Step setting 
    Added GraphPane.IsFontsScaled 
    Added GraphPane.BaseDPI for proper printer scaling 
    Fixed broken logarithmic scales 
    Fixed roundoff problems that caused minor cosmetic annoyances 
    Fixed bad rendering of Y2 axis grid and tics 
    Fixed zeroline flag 
    Bars now work properly with XAxis.IsReverse and FindNearestPoint() 
    Fixed other minor bugs 

10-Jun-2004 (Release 1.4)
    Added Bar Charts 
    Added FindNearestPoint() method 
    Minor Bug Fixes 
    Added zero-line when axis ranges from negative to positive 
    Added ScaleFormatAuto property so the ScaleFormat can be manual even when the scale range is auto 
    Added IsAxisRectAuto property so the AxisRect can be set manually 

1-Mar-2004 (Release 1.3)
    Added Date-Time Axis capability 
    Added Text Axis capability 
    Added ReverseTransform() function (returns axis values associated with a mousePt location on the graph) 
    Made some optimizations that dramatically increase the drawing speed for large datasets 
    Updated code to implement ICloneable interface and copy constructor for primary classes 
    Updated axis label code so that axis edge does not have to begin with a label (ex: axis min is 175, but first label is 200 and step is 50) 
    (Only the ZedGraphControl source file has changed) 

28-Nov-2003 (Release 1.2)
    Fixed the Axis.IsMinorOppositeTic bug (it wasn't working) 
    Changed over the ZedGraph code so that it can also be a UserControl 

13-Nov-2003 (Release 1.1)
    Fixed a minor bug in FontSpec.BoundingBox() calculation
