13-Jul-2004 (Release 1.5)
    Added AxisType.Ordinal 
    Added Def.Ax.MaxTextLabels and made Text labels honor the Axis.Step setting 
    Added GraphPane.IsFontsScaled 
    Added GraphPane.BaseDPI for proper printer scaling 
    Fixed broken logarithmic scales 
    Fixed roundoff problems that caused minor cosmetic annoyances 
    Fixed bad rendering of Y2 axis grid and tics 
    Fixed zeroline flag 
    Bars now work properly with XAxis.IsReverse and FindNearestPoint() 
    Fixed other minor bugs 

10-Jun-2004 (Release 1.4)
    Added Bar Charts 
    Added FindNearestPoint() method 
    Minor Bug Fixes 
    Added zero-line when axis ranges from negative to positive 
    Added ScaleFormatAuto property so the ScaleFormat can be manual even when the scale range is auto 
    Added IsAxisRectAuto property so the AxisRect can be set manually 

1-Mar-2004 (Release 1.3)
    Added Date-Time Axis capability 
    Added Text Axis capability

    Made some optimizations that dramatically increase the drawing speed for large datasets 
    Updated code to implement ICloneable interface and copy constructor for primary classes 
    Updated axis label code so that axis edge does not have to begin with a label (ex: axis min is 175, but first label is 200 and step is 50) 
    (Only the ZedGraphControl source file has changed) 

28-Nov-2003 (Release 1.2)
    Fixed the Axis.IsMinorOppositeTic bug (it wasn't working)
